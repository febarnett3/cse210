Week 01
    -CLI = command line interface --> dotnet
        -to compile you build compiles it into CIL (common intermediate language)
        -CIL goes into the CLR which is then converted into native machine code.
    - Terminal terms: "dotnet run", "dotnet build"
    -make sure you change your path to the program file
    -CTRL+backtick automantically opens the terminal
Week 02
    - Disable "ImplicitUsings" and "Nullable" in the .csproj file of a program.
    -how to solve the problem of variables named the same thing: use namspaces
        -namespace is like a logical folder/grouping. You can type in keyword "namespace InsertName{}" curly brackets is what holds
        everything in it namespace. If namespace not declared, everything would be in the global namespace of Program.
    -Run time always starts at Main().
    -CODE, COMPILE, RUN, DECODE
    -try dotnet new console. What happens? What other projects than console can I create?
    -Git is a type of version control. 
    -versioning: you are able to update your code online for collaboration.
    -you cn revert back to a previous version
    -git is local on your laptop, that's where it works.
    -git can save a copy, and that's where versioning comes from just lots of copies that are tagged with a mesage.
    -multiple copies all local on your laptop
    -git add adds a folder
    -git commit, makes a copy on your system that is tagged with the time and who did it.
    -you are able to keep track of versions and have that data available over the history of time.
    -distributed version control systems: centralized, copies or changes can be saved in an internet location 
    making it available to other users as well
    -git and github same software? no, they are 2 different entities. there are other sites you can use instead of github
    -what does gitpush do? sends the changes you saved to the cloud. sends all the commits that have not been stored to that central location
    -you can pull chnges from github to your local git
    -what happens if 2 people push to the same repository at the same time. github is gonna tell you there is a conflict, it merges changes together too.
    if 2 people are changing something, the service doesn't know which to take precedence, it will tell you the conflict.
    -a human has got to fix that problem of merge conflict
    -commands you should know: git clone, git add, git commit, git push, git pull (practice using this git command line)
    -git is to save you from losing information
Week 03:
    -What is abstraction?
        -Making complex statements simple
        -This brings up classes
    -What is a class?
        -highly cohesive grouping of functions that operate on the same data structure
        -classes has attirbutes(the variables) and methods(the functions).
        -classes must hae  blanace between generalization and specialization. Too much of either are not useful
        -it probably better to be more towards generalization. Specialization makes it less flexible
        -Have class name, have responsibility statement
    -Language keywords introduced: class & new
Week 05:
    -Encapsulaton: Making things private
    -Getters & Setters: there is not much a of reason to include them.
Week08:
    - Inheritance. <has a> is now <is a>
    - There is a class that is the base class. Classes derived from base class inherit certain attributes/behaviors from the base class.
    - This creates more specificiity
